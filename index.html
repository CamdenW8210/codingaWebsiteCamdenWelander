<p>This website is about web design created by Camden Welander as a student project for ARTD 245: Web Design at North Central College in Naperville, IL, in 2024. All the text comes from the following articles located on the Dribbble website. All the images were created by me using Photoshop. The website has been created using HTML and CSS in Dreamweaver. </p>
